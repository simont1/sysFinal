# Project 2: The Final Frontier
#### - by Simon Tsui pd4

**Project Description**
This project was inspired by the tamagotchi handheld digital pet game. In playing this game, your pet will gain traits like experience. Progress is saved in a text file upon exiting the app unless the program is keyboard interrupted. Networking was used for the sole purpose of maintaining a leaderboard text file. This was deemed the best way to have a leaderboard so users can't edit the leaderboard file as they pleased. The game is also educational, containing an informational background on your dog.

**Required Libraries**
None

**Instructions**
1. Compiling the Code

2. Running the Program
Once the program is running, users will be prompted to adopt a new pet or load their previous pet from the save file. The main menu of the game consists of a list of possible actions available to the user with ways to interact and train your dog. There is also a way to access stats and background info on your dog.
