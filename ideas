Ideas for leveling up your dog
- maze generator/premade "parks" --> finishing the maze vs that of an opponent
- interacting with other ppl's dogs
- generating pages about your dogs for other people to view and interact with
- saving and loading progress from files

Interacting with other ppl's dogs (networking)
- sending each other information about your dog
- "adopting" other ppl's dogs, copying their save file essentially
- Leaderboard?

When loading, maybe show them which files they can choose from?
